    <h2>Personal Blog Website project / Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree</h2>
    <h3>Project Details:</h3>
    <p>This repo is the first project in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. The project is focused on combining HMTL5, CSS3, responsive design principles, as well as CSS Flexblox & Grid to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This specific example creates the structure of a hiking blog, with a main blog website showing the latest entries (in cards) and the layout of a specific sample blog entry. Media queries add responsiveness to enable the same experience across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
