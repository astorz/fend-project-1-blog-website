# Personal Blog Website

## Project Details:

This repo is the first project in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. The project is focused on combining HMTL5, CSS3, responsive design principles, as well as CSS Flexblox & Grid to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling.

This specific example creates the structure of a hiking blog, with a main blog website showing the latest entries (in cards) and the layout of a specific sample blog entry. Media queries add responsiveness to enable the same experience across different devices and screen sizes.
